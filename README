PoolCounter is a network daemon which provides mutex-like functionality,
with a limited wait queue length. If too many servers try to do the same
thing at the same time, the wait queue overflows and some configurable action
might be taken by subsequent clients, such as displaying an error message or
using a stale cache entry.

See <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/PoolCounter> for more details.

== Installation ==

You need libevent (libevent-dev on Debian-based systems).

$ make
$ sudo make install

There is no daemonize code, so you'll want to background it with something
like systemd.

== License ==
Released under the GPL v3, or any later version. See COPYING for more details.
