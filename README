PoolCounter is a network daemon which provides mutex-like functionality,
with a limited wait queue length. If too many servers try to do the same
thing at the same time, the wait queue overflows and some configurable action
might be taken by subsequent clients, such as displaying an error message or
using a stale cache entry.

See <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/PoolCounter> for more details.

== Installation ==

You need libevent (libevent-dev on Debian-based systems).

$ make
$ sudo make install

There is no daemonize code, so you'll want to background it with something
like systemd.

=== Running tests ===

==== Local environment ====
You will need to have pytest installed (python3-pytest on Debian-based
systems).

$ make test

If you want to test against an already built PoolCounter (like a packaged
version), you can set an environment variable:

$ POOLCOUNTERD=/usr/bin/poolcounterd pytest

To run the test suite as well as a Python linter to match what CI does, you
can use tox:

$ tox

==== Using Docker ====

With Docker, build the image and run the tests from a container using:

$ make test-ci
